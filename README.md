**Installation**

Instead of installing this module, I suggest you to prefer cloning 
https://github.com/bwqr/fmblog-backend-starter repo and start the project.
This is due to complexity of configuring initial project. Anyway if 
you want to configure project yourself, you can find the steps in 
aforementioned repo.
